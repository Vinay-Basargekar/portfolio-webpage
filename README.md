## Links

- Live Site URL: [Visit again!](https://portfolio-webpage-lake.vercel.app/)

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

## What I learned

The way the hover appears and the form section at the end. I love how it turned out!
I would love to hear your suggestion over this :smile:


## Continued development

I would like to praction position relative and absolute to the site I created. Also, I want to
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
