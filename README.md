### What I learned

The way the hover appears and the form section at the end. I love how it turned out!
I would love to hear your suggestion over this :smile:


### Continued development

I would like to praction position relative and absolute to the site I created. Also, I want to
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

I would like to continue to practice position relative and absolute by adding more decorative elements to the sites that I create.  Also, I would also like to use the fade effect found on the projects in the desktop view, larger than 1400px, when the mouse hovered over them.  It would be help solidify the forEach() loop more.
